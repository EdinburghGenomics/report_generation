{% block method %}
<h2 style="font-size:2.0em;">Method</h2>
Edinburgh Genomics:Clinical Genomics utilises Illumina SeqLab which integrates Illumina TruSeq Nano library
preparation, cluster generation on Illumina cBot2 and sequencing using Illumina HiSeqX with Genologics
Clarity LIMS X Edition and Hamilton Microlab STAR integrative automation.
{% endblock %}

{% block sample_qc %}
<h3 style="font-size:1.3em;">Sample QC</h3>
Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples are evaluated for quantity and quality using an AATI, Fragment Analyzer and the DNF-487
Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit.  The AATI ProSize 2.0 software provides a quantification value and a
quality (integrity) score for each gDNA sample.
Genomic DNA samples found to have a quality score <7 and have little or no high molecular weight material fails
Sample QC and replacement samples are requested.  Based on the quantification results, gDNA samples are
pre-normalised to fall within the acceptable range of the Illumina SeqLab TruSeq Nano library preparation method
using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR.
{% endblock %}

{% block library_prep %}
<h3 style="font-size:1.3em;">Library Preparation</h3>
Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq Nano High Throughput library
preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity LIMS X Edition. The gDNA samples are
normalisedto the concentration and volume required for the Illumina TruSeq Nano library preparation kits then sheared
to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator. The inserts are ligated with blunt ended,
A-tailed, size selected, TruSeq adapters and enriched using 8 cycles of PCR amplification.
{% endblock %}

{% block library_qc %}
<h3 style="font-size:1.3em;">Library QC</h3>
The libraries are evaluated for mean peak size and quantity using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS
LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit. The libraries are normalised to 5nM using the GX data and the actual
concentration was established using a Roche LightCycler 480 and a Kapa Illumina Library Quantification kit and Standards.
{% endblock %}

{% block sequencing %}
<h3 style="font-size:1.3em;">Sequencing</h3>
The libraries are normalised, denatured, and pooled in eights for clustering and sequencing using a Hamilton MicroLab
STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X Edition.  Libraries are clustered onto HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the
clustered flow cell is transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.

{% block bioinformatics_analysis %}
<h3 style="font-size:1.3em;">Bioinformatics analysis</h3>
The demultiplexing is performed using bcl2fastq ({{bcl2fastq_version}}) allowing 1 mismatch when assigning reads to a
barcodes. Adapters (Read1: {{adapter1}}, Read2: {{adapter2}}) are trimmed during the demultiplexing process.
